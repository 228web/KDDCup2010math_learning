Student Performance on Mathematical Problems (KDD Cup 2010)
=======================

This project contains some data science applications on the dataset taken from the 2010 KDD Cup, a data mining challenge. The challenge is to predict student performance on mathematical problems from the logs of student interactions with a computer system, the "Intelligent Tutoring System".
